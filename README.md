# Housing, Homelessness & Seasonality Project

This project explores homelessness trends, causes, and seasonal patterns in:

- Herefordshire
- South Wales

The aim is to understand:
- when homelessness risk is highest
- what the main causes are
- how patterns differ by region
- and how these reflect wider health and social pressures

This is a learning project built as part of MSc Data Science preparation with
a focus on applied social impact and real-world data.
